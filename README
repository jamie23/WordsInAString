Trying some problems to practice for interviews.

Problem:
The problem was, given a string of characters and a dictionary can you find words in the string.

Current Solution:
The program currently finds the lowest amount of characters that make valid words and outputs them, if it can't find a word it discards the first letter and moves on.
