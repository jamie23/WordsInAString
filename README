Trying some problems to practice for interviews.

Problem:
The problem was, given a string of characters and a dictionary can you find words in the string.

Current Solution:
The program currently finds the lowest amount of characters that make valid words and outputs them, if it can't find a word it discards the first letter and moves on.

Update:
You can now run the program for passing a minimum length for a word check. The program then shows the output words for each run for i up to that value for minimum. Finally it outputs the number for minimum word length which uses the most amount of letters.
